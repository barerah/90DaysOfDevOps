# DevOps Execution Blueprint: My 90-Day Sprint

**Current Status:** Student & Absolute Beginner  
**The Vision:** Moving from *“I’ve heard of Docker”* to *“I can deploy and recover a failing system.”*

---

## 1. My Perspective (The *Why* and *What*)

**DevOps to me:**  
It isn’t a job title; it’s a *fix-it-once* mindset. It’s about making sure developers and operations stop blaming each other by automating the boring in-between work where small mistakes turn into big problems.

**Cloud to me:**  
It’s someone else’s supercomputer that I can rent, break, and scale with code rather than physical cables.

**Why start?**  
Because following tutorials without understanding why things work feels useless. I want to stop copy-pasting commands and start knowing what each step is actually doing

**The Destination:**  
To become a DevOps beginner who can explain what I built, why I built it, and what I learned when it failed.

## 2. 90-Day Milestones (The *Where*)

- **Goal 1:** Move a manual app to a *“set it and forget it”* CI/CD pipeline.
- **Goal 2:** Break a Kubernetes cluster on purpose and learn how to fix it (Chaos Engineering lite).
- **Goal 3:** Write enough Terraform code to spin up an entire infrastructure in under 5 minutes.

## 3. Skill Pillars (The *How*)

### Linux Fluency
No GUI allowed. I want to feel at home in the terminal, managing permissions and networking via CLI.

### Observability
Not just *“is it up?”* but *“why is it slow?”*  
Learning to read logs and metrics like a doctor reads an X-ray.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Treating my servers like cattle, not pets.  
If one dies, I code a new one.

## 4. The Consistency Contract (The *Execution*)

**Weekly Budget:**  
18 Hours  
- 2 hours per weekday  
- 4 hours on the weekend

**The *No-Zero* Rule:**  
I will commit at least one line of code or run one command every single day, no matter how busy I am.  
Consistency is my only metric for success.

**Proof of Work:**  
I will regularly publish LinkedIn posts or Technical Deep-Dive blogs, explaining complex concepts I struggled within the simplest terms possible.
